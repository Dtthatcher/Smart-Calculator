This is a smart calculator project from JetBrains Accademy

It consists of a single class in the Main.kt file

With this calculator you can store variables, reassign variables, and calculate using + - * / and ()

It calculates using a postfix notation

It was a fun little project and hopefully it helps someone trying to use postfix notation in Kotlin!!
